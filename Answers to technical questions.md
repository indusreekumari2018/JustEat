3. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
No, I have not done this.

Legacy systems have certain characteristics such as being static, tightly coupled and monolithic blocks of procedural code. 
These systems were not built for the modern Agile workflows that focus on incremental and iterative deliveries. 
A significant majority of these systems are written to operate in batch mode.Testing the systems requires cycling through multiple business days, 
which simply limits the level of agility you want to introduce in the organization.

There are a number of DevOps tools emerging on the legacy landscape which can help your legacy delivery teams get on to the DevOps and Agile journey.
